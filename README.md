The app uses the [CNB's daily exchange rate feed.](https://www.cnb.cz/en/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-market/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/central-bank-exchange-rate-fixing/daily.txt)

Rates are updated once per business day at 14.30 by CNB.

### CORS

Due to CORS issues with the CNB endpoint, we handle it through:
- Development: Vite dev server proxy (see `vite.config.ts`)
- Production: Vercel rewrites configuration (see `vercel.json`)
